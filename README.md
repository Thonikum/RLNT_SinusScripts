# RLNT SinusBot Scripts


This is just  a collection of some scripts made by RLNT to give useful features to the SinusBot.
Feel free to use them if you want.

Currently included:
- Automated Header Groups v1.0.3
  - can assign a header group when one of the trigger groups was assigned
  - can remove the header group when all of the trigger groups are removed
- Automated Server Groups v1.1.3
  - can assign a server group when another servergroup is assigned or removed
  - can remove a server group when another servergroup is assigned or removed
  - can also check for multiple groups (either all are needed or just one out of a given array)
  - since v1.1.0 also supports multiple server groups at the same time
